## Description
```
This website is from a developer that left the company to focus 100% on CTFs. When he left, he was mumbling something about a secret he had hidden in the git repo... Can you help us find it?  <br/>
He is lazy and well known to clone git, deploy on the spot and leave everything...<br/><br/>
