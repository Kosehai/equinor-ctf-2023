## Description
```
We have discovered a compromised machine on our network that is extracting sensitive information in a very creative way. Will you help us find out what information is being extracted?

For your convenience we have attached a setup exactly like the one in production, but it contains mock sensitive data and different certificates. Hopefully this will assist you in production where you will get root access to the gateway server.

The password is 'trust_but_verify', but we recommend changing it to avoid nosy CTF contestants up in your environment.
