Solve the puzzle and save all the animals. Show the solved puzzle to EPT staff to receive flag.

You will receive a random puzzle to solve from a pool of puzzles of similar difficulty.

RULES:
- Do not bring a phone to the IQ puzzle area. There will be severe consequences point-wise if you are caught haxxing.
- You can collaborate with others from your team.
- If you, or anyone from your group/team leaves the puzzle area you must turn in the puzzle sheet and forfeit your attempt. On re-entry you will receive a new random puzzle to solve from the pool.
