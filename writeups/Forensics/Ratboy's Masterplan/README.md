## Description
```
Intelligence suggests that someone in our organization is leaking sensitive information to an external entity. Our ultra-leet mega secure data loss prevention solution has not alerted on any such activity, but our tech team has managed to intercept a chunk of network traffic which we believe contain the rat's communication. Please find a way to get a peek at the leaked data. (<strike>Hackback</strike> Active Defense is not a crime?)
